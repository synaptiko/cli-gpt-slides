# What is cli-gpt

- CLI tool emulating ChatGPT in your terminal
- conversations persisted per folder
- initial system message and example conversation can be provided
- local files can be included in the conversation
- one-shot and multiline modes
- model's parameters can be configured

<!--
- `cli-gpt` is CLI tool emulating ChatGPT in your terminal
- you can have conversations persisted per folder which is useful when you work on different projects
- it allows to specify initial system message and example conversation (which is recommended to direct GPT's behaviour)
- local files (including their path and name) can be included in the conversation
- it has one-shot and multiline modes
- model's parameters can be configured globally too (temperature aka creativity etc.)

# My motivation to create it

- ChatGPT is cumbersome
- more focused flow; easily attach files
- nicely integrates into VSCode's terminal
- quick one-shot questions while browsing in floating terminal window
- can be aliased to `ai` and similar
- learn how to work with [OpenAI's API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat)

<!--
- I found ChatGPT cumbersome when using it during development.
- With `cli-gpt` I can stay more focused, I can easily attach files when needed.
- The flow I use in VSCode is having one terminal tab dedicated to conversation with `cli-gpt`.
- For quick one-shot questions while browsing, I can open new floating terminal window and ask it directly.
- The `cli-gpt` command can be aliased to `ai` and similar.
- I also wanted to learn how to work with OpenAI's API when I saw a lot of different other tools.

# How I made it (part 1)

- [Deno](https://deno.land/), GitHub Actions & OpenAI's API
- Used ChatGPT to create a quick draft of the tool
- Used the draft tool to improve itself

<!--
- I wanted to create it quickly and also learn a bit about Deno, GitHub Actions and AI utilization for creative process.
- I initially used ChatGPT to create a draft of the tool.
- Once I had something working, I started using the tool itself to improve it.
  The advantage was that I could include up-to-date files and ask AI to make changes for me.
  Then it was just a matter of copy and pasting it back.

# How I made it (part 2)

- Modern JavaScript & Deno features
  - [`for await`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of) and [`yield`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function*)
  - [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch)
- Response streaming (aka AI typing back)
- Deno's Node.js compatibility layer for prompt
- GitHub Actions for checks & releases

<!--
- I used modern JavaScript and Deno features like:
	- `for await` and `yield` (and async iterators/generators)
	- `fetch`
- This allowed me to easily implement streaming of the response
- I also used Deno's Node.js compatibility layer to work with terminal fuctionality (ie. multiline prompt)
- I used GitHub Actions to check the code and publish the binary

```ts
async *complete(): AsyncGenerator<string> {
  // ...
  const response = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', { body: { /* ... */ stream: true } });
  // ...
  for await (const chunk of response.body) {
    const lines = chunk.split('\n');

    for (const line of lines) {
      if (line.startsWith('data: ')) {
        const payload = line.slice(6);

        if (payload !== '[DONE]') {
          const message = JSON.parse(payload);
          const delta = message.choices[0].delta;
          const { content } = delta;

          if (content !== undefined) {
            yield content;
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

  return new Promise((resolve) => {

    rl.on('line', (line: string) => {
      text.push(line);

      if (!multiline) {
        rl.close();

    rl.on('close', () => {

# How I made it (part 4)

- AI helped with [`README.md`](https://github.com/synaptiko/cli-gpt/blob/master/README.md#fun-fact) and [`--help`](https://github.com/synaptiko/cli-gpt/blob/master/src/printHelp.ts)
- Also with [plugin system brainstorming](https://github.com/synaptiko/cli-gpt/blob/master/brainstorming/Plugin%20System.md)

<!--
- AI also helped me with various tasks like creating `README.md` and command documentation for `--help`
- I also used it for initial brainstorming about plugin system

# Future of cli-gpt

- Inspired by:
  - [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT)
  - [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi)
  - [`opencommit`](https://github.com/di-sukharev/opencommit)/[`aicommits`](https://github.com/Nutlope/aicommits)

=>

- Plugin system
	- intercepting outgoing/incoming messages
	- execute commands, chain other AI APIs/tools

<!--
- I got inspired by various new tools using GPT, namely
	- Agent systems like AutoGPT, BabyAGI etc.
	- CLI dev tools like `opencommit` and `aicommits`
- I'd like to implement plugin system which can be used to implement similar functionality these tools provide
- Plugins can enhance the functionality by intercepting outgoing & incoming messages
  For example: plugin can understand when AI suggests to edit a file and it can update the local file based on the instruction for you;
               or you can create a command which will create a changelog entry for you and similar
